The carbon cycle is known as a key driver of climatic variations. A major global cooling is recorded during the Late Miocene – Early Pliocene (10 Ma – 4 Ma) linked to a drastic atmospheric CO2 concentration decrease. This climatic event, corresponding to a shift inthe carbon cycle dynamics, is contemporary to an increase in the global planktonic productivity in the oceans: the Biogenic Bloom.Plankton, and more particularly the calcareous nannoplankton, is a key actor in the carbon cycle due to its abundant production oforganic matter (biological pump) and CaCO3 (carbonate pump and counter-pump). The MioCarb project aims to 1) quantify thecalcareous nannoplankton productivity during the Biogenic Bloom, 2) identify the biotic and abiotic forcing that led to the Biogenic Bloom during the Miocene – Pliocene climate change and 3) describe the impact of those concurrent events on the carbon cycle
